# Conveyor System Control with Deep Q-Networks
PyTorch implementation of optimized range-inspection control (RIC) or look-ahead control for digital twin automated conveyor system (DT-ACS) with production station as agent, or conceyor-serviced production system (CSPS), using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Profit-Sharing (PS), or PDQN for short.

## Environment

The environment or the requirements for running the project:

- python==3.8.10  
- numpy==1.20.2   
- matplotlib==3.3.4
- pytorch==1.8.1

## Usage

We have made improvements on the whole coding with implementation of Python and PyTorch. So the simulation with all the 
methodologies used in our work can be executed easily with the following actions:

### (1) Simulation with PDQN = _DQN + PS_
```
python main.py
python main.py --model 1
python main.py --model 1 --ps 1
```
The default methodology used is PDQN without any argument parser highlighted.

### (2) Simulation with DQN
```
python main.py --model 1 --ps 2
```
### (3) Simulation with QL _with PS_
```
python main.py --model 2
python main.py --model 2 --ps 1
```
### (4) Simulation with QL
```
python main.py --model 2 --ps 2
```
We indicated the total rewards as the criterion for comparison among performance of different methodologies.

Our work has been built on the great work from Tang, Hao team from Hefei University of Technology, 
as they have done excellent work on modeling the look-ahead control problem for conveyor-serviced production system with semi-Markov process.
